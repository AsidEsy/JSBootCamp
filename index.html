    <h1>Js -BootCamp answers</h1>
    <a>QS _ 1,2 ,14 in consoles </a>
    <h3>QS - 4 </h3>
    <p>== Equality Operator, means the equality comparison is based on values after type coercion.it will attempt to
        convert one or both of the values into a common type.
    </p>
    <p> === Strict Equality Operator, it doesn't perform type coercion, and checks for both value and type equality</p>
    <h3>QS - 5 </h3>
    <p>var and let are both used for variable declarations,by the scope - var is function-scoped and let is block-scoped
    </p>
    <p>var is hoisted in top of their scope. we can use a variable before declarations hows undefined , in case of let
        it is not initialized , so variable before its declaration shows ReferenceError.</p>
    <p> var allows re-declaration of the same variable within the same scope but let does'nt </p>
    <h3>QS - 6 </h3>
    <p>Implicit type coercion - automatic conversion of data types, </p>
    <p>eg :
        let num = 2;
        let str = "10";
        let result = num + str;

        result becomes - '210'
        here + operator is used for string concatenation.
    </p>
    <h3>QS - 7</h3>
    <p>JS is considered a dynamically typed language</p>
    <h3>QS - 8</h3>
    <p>NaN -Not a Number, its a special value , means result of an operation that should return a number but doesn't</p>
    <h3>QS - 9</h3>
    <p>"pass by value"- the actual value of the var is passed to function, here copy of the data is made, and changes to
        the parameter inside that function do not affect the org variable outside the function</p>
    <p>pass by reference"- a reference or memory address of the variable is passed to function. Changes to the param
        inside the function affect the original var outside the function</p>
    <h3>QS - 10</h3>
    <p>Immediately Invoked - it is a function that is defined and executed immediately after its creation, used to
        encapsulate code</p>
    <h3>QS - 11</h3>
    <p>Strict mode - it enhances error-checking and security</p>
    <p>Error handling, Eliminates coercion of 'this',No duplicate parameter names </p>

    <h3>QS - 12</h3>
    <p>Higher order func - functions that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other
        functions</p>

    <h3>QS - 13</h3>
    <p>this - keyword refers to the context in which a function is executed</p>
    <p>regular function, this refers to the global object </p>


    <h3>QS - 15</h3>
    <p>these methods are used to manipulate the this value inside a function</p>
    <p>call- is used to invoke a function with a specific this context and allows passing arguments individually</p>
    <p>apply- method is similar to call(), but it allows passing arguments as an array</p>
    <p> bind - it returns a new function that can be called later</p>

    <h3>QS - 17</h3>
    <p>Currying - each function in the sequence returns a new function that expects the next argument. This process
        continues until all arguments are provided, and the final function produces the result</p>
